Written by Salim El Atache // Date: 12/11/2020

The purpose of this project is to control the PLC registers (read the inputs and change the outputs) using modbusTCP and pymodbus libraries in Python.
The continuation of this project is to make a GUI for easier control and display of information. 

Enjoy!
